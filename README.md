## Initial wireframe of the game.

Wireframe minesweeper

1. Title for the game.

2. Game Grid and Board:
   The top section will feature a box displaying the mine count.
   A small timer will increment upwards during gameplay.
   A smiley face icon will serve as a game status indicator, turning sad when the game is lost and changing to a cool guy wearing sunglasses emoji upon victory. The smiley face also acts as a reset game button.

3. Game Board:
   The game board itself consists of a 9x9 grid.
   It randomly generates bombs when the player clicks on boxes, gradually revealing more of the board, except for the areas containing bombs.

4. Status Messages (Above or Below the Grid):
   Display messages for the player, such as "You won!" (cool guy emoji) or "Game Over" (sad guy emoji) when the game is won or lost.
   Include a "Play Again" button for restarting the game.

5. Adding the Ability to Place Red Flags:
   Allow players to 'right click' red flags to cover mines and prevent them from exploding.

6. Timer:
   Enable players to record their best game times. This feature will allow players to track and save their fastest completion times in the game.
